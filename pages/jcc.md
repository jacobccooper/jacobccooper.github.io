Growing up in Western Colorado, I was fascinated by the diversity and geography that surrounded me. I was always extremely interested in maps and birds, and as an adult found a way to merge these interests through ecological niche modeling and studies of biogeography. I got my undergraduate degree at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge before continuing on towards a Masters at the University of Kansas and a second Masters and a PhD at the University of Chicago and the Field Museum. I'm currently a Postdoc at the University of Kansas and an adjunct lecturer at Haskell Indian Nations University in Lawrence, Kansas. I have been fortunate enough to be able to work on 5 continents, though I am particularly interested in Neotropical montane birds and Afrotropical bird communities. While I am not in a position to take students at the present time, I am always looking for undergraduates to work with and I am hoping to establish a lab with graduate students in the future.
