## Current Folks   {#current-folks}

#### Jacob C. Cooper (IRACDA Postdoctoral Fellow)
Growing up in western Colorado, Jacob was fascinated by the diversity of birds in the southwestern "sky islands" and the patchy, limited distributions of plants and animals in this rugged region. Jacob now studies the ecology and evolution of (mostly) birds worldwide, focusing specifically on the ecology and distribution of North American birds and on the ecology and biogeography of African birds. At the present time, he is a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Kansas, an adjunct lecturer at Haskell Indian Nations University, a Research Associate of the Field Museum in Chicago, and an affiliate of the Biodiversity Initiate (which he helped start). Jacob is a Citizen of the [Cherokee Nation](https://cherokee.org/).

## Past Folks   {#past-folks}

### Undergraduates
	
#### Mélusine Velde
Mélusine is broadly interested in conservation and biodiversity. Equally at home in the US and France, Mélusine has worked on a variety of projects on three continents, and her undergraduate thesis focused on testing the predictions of ecological niche models in Costa Rica. Mélusine recently completed a masters at Imperial College, Silwood Park.

#### Sara Velásquez Restrepo
Sara is broadly interested in biodiversity and conservation, and enjoys birding and traveling. Her undergraduate thesis focused on studying ecological niche diversity in cotingas in South America. Sara is currently pursuing a PhD at the Universidad EAFIT in Medellín working on methods to use environmental DNA to detect rare taxa.

#### Gracie Lou Cooper
Gracie is particularly interested in the temporal ecology of rabbits, squirrels, and opossums in her yard. She also studies physics related to spherical objects, particularly when these objects are thrown at high speed.
