This page is managed by Dr. Jacob C. Cooper, who can be reached at cooperj2 [at] unk "dot" edu. If you'd like to schedule a meeting, you can find times when I am available on my [public calendar here](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/7dcd0059210e4b8cbf516ecd8cc6137b@unk.edu/c45458870a984f50a9044c4c827ec93e18094584178685809907/calendar.html).

We are located in the Bruner Hall of Science on the main campus of the University of Nebraska at Kearney.
