#### Jacob C. Cooper (IRACDA Postdoctoral Fellow)
<p align="justify">Growing up in western Colorado, I was fascinated by the diversity of birds in the southwestern "sky islands" and the patchy, limited distributions of plants and animals in this rugged region. I now study the ecology and evolution of (mostly) birds worldwide, focusing specifically on the ecology and distribution of North American birds and on the ecology and biogeography of African birds. At the present time, I am a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Kansas, an adjunct lecturer at Haskell Indian Nations University, a Research Associate of the Field Museum in Chicago, and an affiliate of the Biodiversity Initiate (which I helped start).</p>
