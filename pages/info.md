We do research on the ecology and evolution of live on Earth, with an emphasis on spatial ecology and biogeography. Our work predominately involves birds, but we use methods that are easily translatable to other taxonomic groups. Our work takes place all over the world, with an emphasis on the Great Plains and Central Africa. 

## Site Information

This website is based on "Feeling Responsive" by Phlow (links in the footer). This template uses icons from [Daniel Bruce](http://entypo.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, stock images from [Unsplash](http://unsplash.com){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, and the programs [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [Backstretch by Scott Robin](http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/backstretch/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

I created logos for this web page in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) using [Platagenet Cherokee](https://freefontsfamily.com/plantagenet-cherokee-font-free/), which is available for personal, non-commercial use, and available from other non-linked sites as well. The mini logo "ᏤᏏ" is an approximation of the pronounciation the initials "JC", the PI's initials, and (so far as JCC knows) does not correspond to any particular word or term.
