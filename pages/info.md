Growing up in Western Colorado, I was fascinated by the diversity and geography that surrounded me. I was always extremely interested in maps and birds, and as an adult found a way to merge these interests through ecological niche modeling and studies of biogeography. I got my undergraduate degree at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge before continuing on towards a Masters at the University of Kansas and a second Masters and a PhD at the University of Chicago and the Field Museum. I'm currently a Postdoc at the University of Kansas and an adjunct lecturer at Haskell Indian Nations University in Lawrence, Kansas. I have been fortunate enough to be able to work on 5 continents, though I am particularly interested in Neotropical montane birds and Afrotropical bird communities. While I am not in a position to take students at the present time, I am always looking for undergraduates to work with and I am hoping to establish a lab with graduate students in the future.

I created logos for this web page in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) using [Platagenet Cherokee](https://freefontsfamily.com/plantagenet-cherokee-font-free/), which is available for personal, non-commercial use, and available from other non-linked sites as well. The mini logo "ᏤᏏ" is an approximation of the pronounciation the initials "JC", and (so far as JCC knows) does not correspond to any particular word or term.
