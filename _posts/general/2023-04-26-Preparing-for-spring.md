A quick update on the goings on in the Cooper Lab @ UNK:

> My contract was renewed! So I will be staying at UNK for the foreseeable future.
> We are currently getting permits approved to survey Central Nebraska birds!
> The migrants are coming! It's always distracting as shorebirds and warblers begin to pour across the prairie.

We are all extremely excited about what the future has in store, and we will provide updates on our research as it progresses. As always, feel free to reach out for more information or to meet up with us in Central Nebraska.
