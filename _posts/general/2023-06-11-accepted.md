Last week, I officially accepted a job at the University of Nebraska at Kearney. The paperwork is currently processing, but I'll be moving to Kearney in early July 2023. This is a tenure-track Assistant Professor position in Biology, with an emphasis on evolutionary biology. I'm excited to become more involved with teaching and to continue doing my research in this fascinating part of the world at a vibrant, active university. I'll post updates here, but feel free to reach out if you'd like more information about the university or the lab that I will be starting soon.
