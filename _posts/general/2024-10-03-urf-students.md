Three undergraduate students working with ornithology at UNK were recently awarded Undergraduate Research Fellowships (URFs), which will help fund their research and allow them to access resources to assist their research.

1. <b>Daniel Flint</b> was awarded a URF for studying niche relationships between related taxa at different spatial scales within the state of Nebraska. He will be working alongside Dr. Jacob C. Cooper & Eugene Huryn, a resident Master's student studying White-breasted Nuthatches <i>Sitta carolinensis</i>.

2. <b>Darcey Taylor</b> was awarded a URF for studying vocal and phenotypic dynamics within the <i>Pipilo</i> hybrid zone. She will be working with Dr. Jacob C. Cooper & Cody McGregor, resident graduate student, and Dr. Lucas DeCicco at the University of Kansas.

3. <b>Mike Roffman</b> was awarded a URF to digitize and analyze historical ornithological data within the state of Nebraska. Mike will be working alongside Dr. Jacob C. Cooper & Dr. Nate Eidem to understand how the birdlife of Nebraska have changed through time.

Congrats to all three of these students! We look forward to seeing what the future holds in store for you all.
