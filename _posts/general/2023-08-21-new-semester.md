Fall semester is off to a good start so far here in Kearney, Nebraska! As a reminder, I am actively looking for students for research projects here at UNK, at both the undergraduate and masters level. Students who are interested in species distributions, biogeography, and the ecology of birds are welcome to reach out to me or stop by and visit at BHS 315.
