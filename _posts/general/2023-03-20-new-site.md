I'm currently working on updating my website and making it sleeker and more encompassing of the research that I perform. I'm also trying to move away from Weebly tools - which is transition to be a subscriber service - towards using Github-based tools that are free to use and to share. It's more in line with my overall professional goals of using freeware and making code and information available to others for use.
